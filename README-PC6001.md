# PC6001 example code

To make it easy to write example code, you can use the following tools:

* Emulator: [PC6001VX](http://eighttails.seesaa.net/article/305067428.html)
* Parser: [N6XBasicChecker](http://eighttails.seesaa.net/article/305067428.html)

Within N6XBasicChecker, there is a tool called `txt2bas` which can convert your textfiles to virtual cassette tapes. This is very useful when trying out your code in the emulator.
