# GUESS

**System**: Generic

**Created by**: anonymous

**Description**:

	GUESS is a simple introduction to the idea of a
computer program and computer games. It also introduces
the notions of comparison and searching a list.
	Before playing GUESS on the computer, you may wish
to play it in class at the chalkboard. One student is selected
to be the computer. He is given the flowchart below and is
asked to follow it and write on the chalkboard the
statements in parentheses as well as each guess. Students
take turns being the computer.

	After playing the game manually, play GUESS on the
computer. Divide the class into small teams of 2 or 3
members each. Have each team play 10 games on the
computer and keep track of the number of guesses required
to get each number. Compute the average guesses for each
team and for the entire class. After playing the class should
consider the following questions:

	1. Why should it never take more than 7 guesses to find
	   the number?

	2. What was the average guesses for the class? How does
	   this compare to the theoretical average (using the
	   correct guessing strategy) of 5.3?

	3. What are the maximum number of guesses required to
	   find a mystery number between:

		1 and 10	1 and 64
		1 and 63	1 and 1000

**NOTE**:

BASIC statements in the original program are abbreviated
to their first three letters. A version modified for Microsoft BASIC
is also included, with full statement names.
