# REVERSE

**System**: Generic

**Created by**: anonymous

**Description**: WIP, OCR or transcritpion from the magazine needed

**NOTE**:
The original listing has an error in line 350 (IF R=0 THEN 520),
which points to a non-existant line 520, instead of line 999.
This has been fixed on the version modified for Microsoft BASIC.

The game will only accept input in uppercase letters.
