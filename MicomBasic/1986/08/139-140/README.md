Mattekure (まってくれ), lit. "Please wait for me", released in the 1986-08 issue of the Micom Basic Magazine by Kenya Komai.

Basic info:
This can only be run on a PC-6001mkIISR or a PC-6601SR, in the N66SR-BASIC mode. Any other models or BASIC modes will not work. To start the program, simply enter "cload" and then enter "run". In the construction mode, you make your own level. You move the cursor with the arrow keys, place objects with the space bar, and press enter when you're done. The first object you place will be your penguin, Penkichi, the second will be the green life preserver, and then the rest of the objects will be the normal red life preservers. You only get one penguin and one goal. Pressing space on an object will make it cycle between all available remaining objects. Starting normally, or on your own constructed level, you play with the arrow keys to move Penkichi along the life preservers. You can push the life preservers across the water by pressing space and pushing the direction of the life preserver you want to push.

Penkichi's voice lines:
Kicking a life preserver: "I'm gonna kick your ass" (apparently, according to deepl)
Beating a level: "Please ride this to go to the south pole"
Starting the next level: "No, no, no. Something else?"
Beating level 10: "Alright!"
Beating your own constructed level: "Original round clear"

DeepL magazine translation:

Story:
There was a penguin in a zoo in a certain town. His name was Penkichi. One day, Penkichi decided to go back to Antarctica, so he sneaked out of the zoo. But when he looked closely, he saw that the river was full of life preservers.

How to play:
You must take Penkichi to the goal (the green life preserver). Penkichi can only walk on the life preservers. If Penkichi gets stuck in the river, they will die. 
You can use the cursor keys to move and the spacebar to get rid of a life preserver. To do this, press the spacebar and Penkichi will shout, "Let's shoot! There are 10 levels in total, and there is no level you can't solve, so please do your best.

Construction:
Press the down arrow key on the title screen to move Penkichi. Press the spacebar to select CONSTRUCTION. The screen will change to the construction menu. 
CONSTRUCTION: This is for creating a level. Press the RETURN key to set the time.
Enter the time of the quotient in the range of 100-1000. Then return to the menu. 
START: This is used to start a level that has been sub-created by CONSTRUCTION. If you hear a beep and it does not start, there is no start or no goal. Please fix it. TITL... Back to the title.

Finally,:
If you don't like the background music, change the data in lines 1790-1800 (one note at a time), and don't forget to add "END" at the end.

Postscript:
When GAME OVER, press space to start the game from the title, or press the right arrow key to start from the dead side.

Checker Flag: (in Micom Basic, this is a column where the Editor, as well as Dr. D, the magazine's fictional character who teaches readers to program a game in BASIC, discuss the game between themselves).
Editor: It's a puzzle game, and it's quite difficult. 

Dr. D: Even on the PC-6001, if you want to play a game of this type, you'll have to go through a lot of trouble. 

Editor: It's because it's fast.
 
Dr. D: That's right. But the way you create the data for the levels is not very good.
